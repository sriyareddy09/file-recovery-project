# Forensic Findings Summary

This report summarizes the key findings from the forensic analysis and file recovery process using Autopsy.

1. Data Source:
   - The original disk image was analyzed with Autopsy.
   - An exported CSV report (`testfolder_report.csv`) contains metadata for all files found.

2. Deleted Files:
   - Using a Python script, files marked as 'unallocated', 'orphan', or 'deleted' in the `Flags(Dir)` column were filtered.
   - A total of X deleted/unallocated files were identified (replace X with the count).

3. Recovered Files:
   - Relevant deleted files were successfully copied to the `recovered_files/` folder.
   - The recovered files include various file types such as images (.jpg), text files (.txt), and documents.

4. Observations:
   - Many deleted files appeared to be recently modified prior to deletion.
   - Some files had partial data or corrupted headers but were still partially recoverable.
   - The use of Autopsy’s timeline and file metadata helped to correlate file activity and deletion times.

5. Conclusion:
   - The combination of Autopsy’s forensic capabilities and Python automation facilitated efficient identification and recovery of deleted files.
   - This workflow can be used to assist in digital forensic investigations requiring deleted file recovery and metadata analysis.
